🎯 COMPLETE SCORING CALCULATION PROCESS
=====================================

This document explains EXACTLY how scores are calculated when you upload a JD 
and search for matching resumes, with real mathematical formulas.
"""

# ====================================================================================
# 📤 STEP 1: JD UPLOAD PROCESS
# ====================================================================================

"""
When you upload a JD file (PDF/TXT):

1. File Processing:
   - Extract text from PDF/TXT file
   - Clean and normalize text
   - Store in MongoDB with session ID

2. Vector Embedding:
   - Convert JD text to 1536-dimensional vector using OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
   - This vector captures semantic meaning of job requirements

3. Search Trigger:
   - Use JD text as search query against Pinecone vector database
   - Find resumes with highest semantic similarity
"""

# ====================================================================================
# 🔍 STEP 2: VECTOR SIMILARITY SEARCH
# ====================================================================================

"""
Vector Similarity Calculation:

1. Cosine Similarity Formula:
   similarity = dot_product(jd_vector, resume_vector) / (||jd_vector|| * ||resume_vector||)

2. Score Range: 0.0 to 1.0
   - 0.0 = No similarity
   - 1.0 = Perfect semantic match

3. Example Results:
   - Resume A: 0.892 (89.2% similarity)
   - Resume B: 0.847 (84.7% similarity) 
   - Resume C: 0.734 (73.4% similarity)

This gives us the PRIMARY SCORE based on semantic similarity.
